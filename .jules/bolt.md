## 2024-05-18 - Optimize SQLite compound key fetches with CTE VALUES
**Learning:** When retrieving a sparse set of rows matched on compound keys (like `doc_id` and `seq`), using a range query like `BETWEEN` retrieves all intermediate rows unnecessarily, which can be massively inefficient. Iterative fetches are also slow due to N+1 queries.
**Action:** Chunk the input keys to stay within parameter limits (`_SQLITE_PARAM_BATCH`), and use a Common Table Expression (CTE) with a `VALUES` clause (`WITH targets(doc_id, seq) AS (VALUES ...)`) joined to the target tables to fetch exactly the rows needed in batches.

## 2024-05-19 - Precompute Loop Invariants in Greedy Selection Algorithms
**Learning:** In greedy selection algorithms like MMR deduplication, recalculating invariant values within nested loops (such as the term `mmr_lambda * norm_score`) drastically increases computational overhead. Because `norm_score` depends only on the candidate's static score and `mmr_lambda` is a constant, recalculating this product inside the inner loop wastes $O(K \times N)$ operations.
**Action:** Always hoist per-item invariant calculations (like `mmr_lambda * norm_score` or `1 - mmr_lambda`) out of nested loops and precompute them in arrays or variables before the loop begins to reduce complexity and improve runtime performance.

## 2024-05-20 - Eliminate batched N+1 SQLite fetches with pre-fetching
**Learning:** During pipeline batched processing (like applying recency boost after MMR deduplication), fetching attributes like `created_at` in an N+1 batched manner using chunks adds an unnecessary database round-trip that increases processing latency, especially for larger arrays.
**Action:** Always pre-fetch the necessary attributes in the initial, early SQL `SELECT` queries that populate the lists (e.g. vector search and FTS query) and carry these attributes down the pipeline in the resulting dictionary to avoid any post-processing N+1 database queries.
