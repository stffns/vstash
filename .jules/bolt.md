## 2024-05-18 - Optimize SQLite compound key fetches with CTE VALUES
**Learning:** When retrieving a sparse set of rows matched on compound keys (like `doc_id` and `seq`), using a range query like `BETWEEN` retrieves all intermediate rows unnecessarily, which can be massively inefficient. Iterative fetches are also slow due to N+1 queries.
**Action:** Chunk the input keys to stay within parameter limits (`_SQLITE_PARAM_BATCH`), and use a Common Table Expression (CTE) with a `VALUES` clause (`WITH targets(doc_id, seq) AS (VALUES ...)`) joined to the target tables to fetch exactly the rows needed in batches.

## 2024-05-19 - Precompute Loop Invariants in Greedy Selection Algorithms
**Learning:** In greedy selection algorithms like MMR deduplication, recalculating invariant values within nested loops (such as the term `mmr_lambda * norm_score`) drastically increases computational overhead. Because `norm_score` depends only on the candidate's static score and `mmr_lambda` is a constant, recalculating this product inside the inner loop wastes $O(K \times N)$ operations.
**Action:** Always hoist per-item invariant calculations (like `mmr_lambda * norm_score` or `1 - mmr_lambda`) out of nested loops and precompute them in arrays or variables before the loop begins to reduce complexity and improve runtime performance.

## YYYY-MM-DD - Optimize MMR deduplication loop with lazy norms and bypass
**Learning:** Calculating vector norms for all chunks upfront in MMR deduplication wastes computation, as many chunks may never be compared if they don't have siblings or aren't selected. Additionally, evaluating similarity penalties for documents with only one chunk is unnecessary.
**Action:** In MMR deduplication, lazily evaluate L2 norms only when a chunk is actually compared against a selected sibling. Bypass similarity penalty updates entirely if the selected chunk is the only one from its document.
